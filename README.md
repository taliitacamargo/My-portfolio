# My-portfolio

In this project, I created my portfolio from scratch. main elements were used  such as body, header, section, main, and article tags for dividing the page into specific sections. I also Used class and id's to specify sections that I wanted to target and style in my css.  hover effects were also an additional to make it a bit more interesting to the eyes along with images required on the project.
